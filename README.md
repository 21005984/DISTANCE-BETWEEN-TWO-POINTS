# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable 
### Step 3: 

Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](.//formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable 
### Step 5: 
Print both values it would be interchanged 
###step 6:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
~~~
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import numpy as np 
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
distance=np.sqrt(((l1[0]-l2[0])**2)+((l1[1]-l2[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
~~~
### OUTPUT:
![output](.//DB.png)
### RESULT:
thus the distance between two point is executed
